# BattleShips

Battleships code written in C language. Personal project from I was personally learning C. 
Has nested loops and proper logic check to ensure game is smooth. This battleship board is smaller than the popular boardgame for personal testing purposes. 
The smaller board does not change to the code other than making games faster.
This supports only single player. The player just has to input the spot using the row and column format (Ex: 1 0 )
